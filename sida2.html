        <p>Pac-Man which was first released in 1980.

            In Pac-Man, the player controls a yellow, circular character named Pac-Man who moves through a maze while consuming small white pellets. The objective is to clear all the pellets while avoiding four ghosts named Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde, who try to catch Pac-Man.
            
            The game is divided into levels, and each level has a set number of pellets to be cleared. The player can also collect larger, flashing pellets called "power pellets," which allow Pac-Man to turn the tables on the ghosts by making them vulnerable and allowing him to eat them.
            
            Pac-Man is widely regarded as a classic and one of the most iconic video games of all time. It has inspired numerous sequels, spin-offs, and merchandise, and is still enjoyed by players of all ages today.</p>
